Some solutions to the [Matasano Crypto Challenges](http://cryptopals.com/) in Clojure. I stopped somewhere during set 5. The code is very experimental, as I was learning Clojure while solving these.

Using the following:

* Leiningen 2.1.2 on Java 1.6.0_65 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM
* Clojure 1.5.1
